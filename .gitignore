# GLOBAL
# Global ignores for general file types.

# Ignore all swap files (usually Vim backups)
*.swp

# Ignore all tablegen generated files.
*.inc

# LLVM
# To avoid capturing the whole of LLVM in the git repo, carefully
# ignore everything that isn't necessary.

# This generally works on a structure of:
#   * Ignore everything in folder X
#   * Unignore everything in subfolder X/Y
#   * Recurse into Y.
